# :earth_africa: GeoLingIt shared task

This repository contains useful materials related to the [GeoLingIt shared task](https://sites.google.com/view/geolingit) at [EVALITA 2023](https://www.evalita.it/campaigns/evalita-2023/). You can find more information about how to participate, how data looks like, and which subtasks are available on the [shared task website](https://sites.google.com/view/geolingit).

### :page_with_curl: Get the data

If you are interested in participating in the GeoLingIt shared task, please fill out the [**expression of interest form**](https://forms.gle/TW2NveAZMZodF7Z59) by EVALITA organizers (by Apr 30th, 2023) indicating **"GeoLingIt â€“ Geolocation of Linguistic Variation in Italy"** as preference. We will send to you the link to join the dedicated Google Group, from where you can obtain the development data. There you can keep in touch with us and ask any shared task-related questions.

### :triangular_ruler: Data format

The dataset is in a tab-separated format, with an example per line and the first line as header. We provide `train_a.tsv` and `dev_a.tsv` for **Subtask A**, and `train_b.tsv` and `dev_b.tsv` for **Subtask B**. Test data will be available during the evaluation window (i.e., May 7th-14th, 2023). Depending on the subtask, the column with answers differ as follows.

#### Subtask A

Each example has three columns:
- **id**: the tweet identifier, that we programmatically change to preserve user's anonymity;
- **text**: the text of the tweet, with masked user mentions, email addresses, URLs, and locations from cross-posting;
- **region**: the region of Italy in a string format.

**Note**: the format of prediction files for this subtask must follow this exact format to be properly evaluated.

#### Subtask B

Each example has four columns:
- **id**: the tweet identifier, that we programmatically change to preserve user's anonymity;
- **text**: the text of the tweet, with masked user mentions, email addresses, URLs, and locations from cross-posting;
- **latitude**: a float representing the latitude coordinate of the tweet;
- **longitude**: a float representing the longitude coordinate of the tweet.

**Note**: the format of prediction files for this subtask must follow this exact format to be properly evaluated.

### :bar_chart: Evaluation and scorer

Predictions will be evaluated according to **macro F1 score** (Subtask A) and **mean distance in km** (Subtask B). We provide participants with a scorer (i.e., `eval.py`). The usage is the following:

```
python eval.py -S $SUBTASK -G $GOLD_FILEPATH -P $PRED_FILEPATH
```
- `$SUBTASK`: The subtask the submission refers to. Choices: ['`a`', '`b`'].
- `$GOLD_FILEPATH`: Path to the gold standard for the subtask.
- `$PRED_FILEPATH`: Path to the file that contains predictions for the subtask, with the same format as `$GOLD_FILEPATH`.

#### Requirements

You will need to install two python packages to run the script: `scikit-learn==1.2.1` and `haversine==2.7.0`.

### :pushpin: Baselines

We consider the following baselines to allow participants to assess their results during development (further baselines will be provided in the coming weeks!).

#### Subtask A

- **Most frequent baseline (MFB)**: this baseline always guesses the most frequent region in the training set (i.e., Lazio) for all validation instances. The macro F1 score on `dev_a.tsv` is: **0.03**.

#### Subtask B

- **Centroid baseline (CB)**: this baseline computes the center point (latitude, longitude) from the training set and predicts it for all test instances. The mean distance in km on `dev_a.tsv` is: **301.65**.
